# Dialogue-Based Student Portal Design using a Large Language Model (LLM)

A school wants to implement a dialogue-based “Student Management Portal”, allowing students to chat with a system regarding their course (results, graduation course requirements, etc.) using microservices. The students can ask about their results, discuss where they need improvement, the number of remaining courses they need to graduate, etc. 

Also, it needs to be ensured that the system does not get overwhelmed with too many dialogues incurring huge costs by building a monitoring system.
